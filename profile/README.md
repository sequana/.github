# Welcome to the github page of [Sequana](https://sequana.readthedocs.io)!

We develop tools and pipelines related to NGS that are used within a Sequencing platform.

Our goal is to provide easy-to-use tools to help students, postdocs, researchers to make the most
of their data. Towards this goal, we wanted to integrate expert knowledge (‘omics’) knowledge
into workflows based and a uniformised user interface for all workflows. To this end, we have decided 
to use Snakemake and Python language and developed a common [toolbox](https://github.com/sequana/sequana_pipetools), re-usable 
[wrappers]([tools](https://github.com/sequana/sequana-wrappers) for Snakemake pipelines, and a general-purpose Python library 
for data analysis [sequana](https://github.com/sequana/sequana).

Our pipelines and tools are tests, documented, validated. There are lots of tools and pipelines 
developed around Sequana. Please have a look [here](https://github.com/sequana) and join us. You are welcome!
